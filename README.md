# 🚖 TaxiDimension

you arrive.

on a quiet street.  
in a world that rides bikes.  
but has never once seen a car.

they stare.  
not in fear. not in awe.  
just… confusion.  
as if something ancient and impossible has just returned.

---

**TaxiDimension** is a *prototype*.  
a vision only partially made real.  
built in Unity, inspired by *Schedule One* and that feeling you get when everyone else seems to understand something you don’t—or vice versa.

you are a **professional taxi driver** from the **Taxi Dimension**.  
a world powered by transit. by structure. by the sacred ritual of *picking someone up and taking them somewhere else.*

but here?  
they only know bikes.  
individual, isolated motion. no doors. no destinations shared.

and now... you're here.

### 🧪 not features — echoes

- 👔 **you are trained. experienced. exact.** they are not.
- 🚲 **the world accepts bikes.** it does not understand anything more.
- 🎮 **gameplay shifts without warning.** it starts with driving. it does not end there.
- 🧠 **meaning is buried, not handed out.** explore. hesitate. question everything.
- 🌀 **systems that change.** or react. or pretend.
- 🧃 **no UI. no path. no explanation.** only motion.
- ❗ **and remember: not everything in this README exists yet.**  
some of it may never.

but the **feeling** is real.  
and it’s already waiting for you.

### 🧩 recapped for the time-impaired:

- 3D Unity prototype  
- you’re a taxi driver from another world  
- everyone rides bikes  
- no one has ever seen a car  
- nothing here makes sense  
- and yet it all *feels* right  
- it’s just a vision  
> for now.

### 🛠 built in unity  
### ☕ assembled from caffeine, fog, and spatial dissonance
