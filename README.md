# 🚖 TaxiDimension. (Prototype.)

you arrive.

on a quiet street.  
the world accepts bikes. bikes with motors. freedom on two wheels.  
but a taxi? they don’t even have a word for it.  
they’ve never even seen a car.

they stare.  
not in fear. not in awe.  
just… confusion.  
like when someone speaks your language, but not your meaning.  
as if something ancient and impossible has just returned.

**TaxiDimension** is a *prototype*.  
a vision.  
only partially made real.  
built in Unity, inspired by *Schedule One* and that feeling of a game you want to play again and again.

you are a **professional taxi driver** from the **Taxi Dimension**.  
a world powered by transit—where only taxis rule the roads... the art of *picking someone up and taking them somewhere else.*

but here?  
they only know bikes.  
individual, isolated motion. no doors. no destinations shared.

and now... you’re here.  
and they’re starting to react.

### 🧪 not features — echoes

- 👔 **you are trained. experienced. exact.** they are not.
- 🚲 **the world accepts bikes.** it doesn’t understand taxis. it barely even has context for you.
- 🎮 **this is not just driving.** it starts with driving. it does not end there.
- ❗ **and remember: not everything in this README exists yet.**  
some of it may never.

> this game is a prototype.  
> this story is a draft.  
> this world is unfinished.

but the **feeling** is real.  
and it’s already waiting for you.

### 🧩 recapped for the time-impaired:

- 3D Unity prototype  
- you’re a taxi driver from another world  
- everyone rides bikes  
- no one has ever seen a car  
- nothing here makes sense  
- and yet it all *feels* right  
- it’s just a vision  
> for now.

### 🛠 built in unity  
### ☕ assembled from caffeine, thanks to unity3D and inspiration from Schedule I.

note to self: the driver doesn't know everything yet.
