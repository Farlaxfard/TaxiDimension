# 🚖 The taxi dimension => Prototype.

you arrive.

on a quiet street.
in a world that rides bikes, bikes with motors.  
but has never once seen a car.

they stare.
not in fear. not in awe.
just… confusion.
as if something ancient and impossible has just returned.

---

**TaxiDimension** is a *prototype*.
a vision only partially made real. 
built in Unity, inspired by *Schedule One* and that feeling of a game you want to play again and again.

you are a **professional taxi driver** from the **Taxi Dimension**.  
a world powered by transit. nobody but taxis drive the roads, *picking someone up and taking them somewhere else.*

but here?
they only know bikes.
individual, isolated motion. no doors. no destinations shared.

and now... you're here.

### 🧪 not features — echoes

- 👔 **you are trained. experienced. exact.** they are not.
- 🚲 **the world accepts bikes.** it does not understand anything more of a taxi, what's a taxi?
- 🎮 **this is not just driving.** it starts with driving. it does not end there.
- ❗ **and remember: not everything in this README exists yet.**  
some of it may never.

> this game is a prototype.
> this story is a draft.
> this world is unfinished.

but the **feeling** is real.  
and it’s already waiting for you.

### 🧩 recapped for the time-impaired:

- 3D Unity prototype  
- you’re a taxi driver from another world  
- everyone rides bikes  
- no one has ever seen a car  
- nothing here makes sense  
- and yet it all *feels* right  
- it’s just a vision  
> for now.

### 🛠 built in unity  
### ☕ assembled from caffeine, and a love of gamedev.

> you’ve already read this far.
