# 🚖 TaxiDimension. (Prototype.)

you arrive.

on a quiet street.  
the world accepts bikes. bikes with motors. freedom on two wheels.  
but a taxi? they don’t even have a word for it.  
they’ve never even seen a car.

they stare.  
not in fear. not in awe.  
just… confusion.  
like when someone speaks your language, but not your meaning.  
as if something ancient and impossible has just returned.

**TaxiDimension** is a *prototype*.  
a vision.  
only partially made real.  
built in Unity, inspired by *Schedule One* and that feeling of a game you want to play again and again.

you are a **professional taxi driver** from the **Taxi Dimension**.  
a world powered by transit—where only taxis rule the roads... the art of *picking someone up and taking them somewhere else.*

here, where they only know bikes.  
individual, isolated motion. no doors. no destinations shared.

and now... you’re here.  
and they’re starting to react.  
and your goal is simple:  
**revive what was lost.**

### 🧪 not features — echoes

- 👔 **you are trained. experienced. exact.** they are not.  
- 🚲 **the world accepts bikes.** it doesn’t understand taxis. it barely even has context for you.  
- 🎮 **this is not just driving.** it starts with driving. it does not end there.  
- ❗ **and remember: not everything in this README exists yet.**  
some of it may never.

> this game is a prototype.  
> this story is a draft.  
> this world is unfinished.

but the **feeling** is real.  
and it’s already waiting for you.

### 🧩 recapped for the time-impaired:

- 3D Unity prototype  
- you’re a taxi driver from another world  
- everyone rides bikes  
- no one has ever seen a car  
- nothing here makes sense  
- your presence here changes everything  
- it’s just a vision  
> for now.

### 🛠 built in unity  
### ☕ assembled from caffeine, thanks to unity3D and inspiration from Schedule I.

<!-- 
note to self: the driver doesn't know everything yet. 
don't forget what the mirror showed. 
the bang wasn’t natural.

> you’ve already read this far.  
> you might as well see what the game does to your brain.

### 📜 The Dimensional Bang

but then came the **dimensional bang**.

the event.  
the implosion.  
the reason everything changed.  
no one believed the warnings. not even you.  
you saw it on the TV—thought it was a troll.  
but that exact moment, the sky began to have a—tear.  
not a crack. not lightning.  
a long, slow tear like paper soaked in time.  
the **Taxi Dimension** is actually gone.

your only escape?  
a forgotten, dusty **dimension shifter** in your basement.  
you didn’t even know why you had it.  
maybe it was always meant for this.  
maybe it was never meant to be used.  
but you used it.  
and now... you’re here.
