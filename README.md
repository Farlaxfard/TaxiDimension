# 🛸 TaxiDimension

**you’re a taxi driver. from another dimension.**  
a place where taxis are more than transportation—they're everything.  
and now... you’ve arrived in a world that’s never even seen one.

*TaxiDimension* is a 3D indie prototype made in Unity.  
inspired by games like *Schedule One*, it plays with mystery, disconnection, and meaning—wrapped in the strange story of a driver far from home, trying to navigate a reality that doesn’t recognize the most fundamental truth: taxis exist.

### 🧪 not features — anomalies

- 👔 **you’re not just a driver.** you’re a professional. a representative of the Taxi Dimension. and you take your craft *very* seriously.
- 🌍 **this world doesn’t know what a taxi is.** there are no passengers, no roads, no rules. it just stares.
- 🌀 **gameplay bends and twists.** sometimes it’s familiar. sometimes it’s... not. you’re not always in control.
- 📻 **storytelling through environment, implication, and absence.** no handholding. no tutorials. just the hum of something missing.
- ❓ **secrets to find, or misinterpret entirely.** you’ll leave unsure whether you played a game or a metaphor.
- 🧃 **prototype energy.** this is the seed, not the tree. but the seed's already kinda weird.

### 🎮 made with unity  
### 💭 born from a question nobody asked:  
> “what if a taxi driver crossed dimensions and no one cared?”
